# Troski Landing Page UI Enhancements

This document outlines the UI enhancements made to the Troski ride-sharing platform landing page, drawing inspiration from Uber's design while incorporating modern design trends, animations, and improved aesthetics.

## Design Philosophy

The redesigned UI follows these core principles:

1. **Visual Storytelling** - Each section tells part of the Troski brand story sequentially
2. **Motion Design** - Subtle animations create a dynamic, engaging experience
3. **Clean Typography** - Clear hierarchical structure with legible fonts
4. **Component-Based Architecture** - Modular design for easier maintenance
5. **Responsive Layout** - Optimized viewing experience across all devices

## Key UI Components

## Animation Strategy

Animations are purposefully designed to enhance rather than distract:

1. **Entrance Animations** - Elements fade and slide into view
2. **Scroll-Triggered Animations** - Content reveals as users scroll down
3. **Hover Effects** - Subtle scaling and shadow changes
4. **Micro-interactions** - Button states and hover effects
5. **Path Animations** - Map routes and vehicle movements

## Color Palette

The color system is based on a primary blue palette with supporting colors:

- Primary Blue: #3b82f6 (blue-500)
- Dark Blue: #1d4ed8 (blue-700)
- Accent Purple: #4f46e5 (indigo-600)
- Neutral Dark: #111827 (gray-900)
- Neutral Light: #f9fafb (gray-50)
- White: #ffffff

## Typography

- Headings: Inter font, bold weight
- Body text: Inter font, regular weight
- Consistent sizing with responsive adjustments
- Clear hierarchy with font weight and size variations

## Responsive Behavior

- Mobile-first approach
- Column layout adjustments at breakpoints
- Image sizes and spacing adjustments
- Navigation changes for mobile devices
